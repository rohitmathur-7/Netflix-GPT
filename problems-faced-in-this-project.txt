1. On page reload "Page Not Found" error was shown.
   - This problem occurs because the server tries to find the exact path to the file, but it does not exist on the server 
     hence it throws "Page not found" error.

   Solution:
   - Set up a catch all route on the server that will serve the index.html file for any request 
     that does not match a static file or an api endpoint.  

   I am hosting my site on Netlify, So here is the Netlify Specific Solution:
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Create a _redirects File, and add this in the file:
     ------> /* /index.html 200

        /* means "match any page"
        /index.html specifies where to redirect
        200 is the HTTP status code indicating a successful redirect

   - The _redirects file tells Netlify to always serve the index.html file for any route,
     allowing your React application's client-side router to handle the actual routing.
